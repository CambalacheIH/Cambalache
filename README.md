### Find products

When you have uploaded your products and set your preferences, go ahead and click on find button to search for products that match with your preferences. Here you can like one product and start creating a match.

### Select one of your products and wait for the other user

The last step is creating a match room with one of your products and wait for the other user involved in the exchange to accept or reject the trade.
